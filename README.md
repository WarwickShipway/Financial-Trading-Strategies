# Financials
Financial code to scrape data, compare against benchmarks, develop long term trading algorithms, learn trading methods, webscraping, machine learning.

** Currently developing **

Long term goals:
Aim is for long term investments, not day trading, hence look at long term strageies, monthly/annual projections and algorithms, general trends
Have a single output of buy/sell/hold. Plots are nice but can spend too long on them
Important if looking long term history to compare to inflation, if % is always going up, then just money increasing

Developing data science skills, and apply some machine learning code to enhance projection forecast estimations
Read up on what the banks and financial institutions are doing, not quants as its high frequency
Include comparison with FTSE index to estimate if trends are working (ie if user was better off just buying a FTSE tracker)

Notes/Development:
Get data from web scraping. Do not spend too much time on this as most developer/investments will have their own data sources
Use ticker function for extraction/comparison of multiple companies shares
Use historical data to evaluate algorithm approaches - develop automated testing/CI skills. Run historic cases with some stocks - see whether to buy a stock (and how much?), then test, eg. buy - moved up 5% in 7 days, sell down 3%, -3<hold<5
Try Kelly Criterion, or other methods?

Other Thoughts:
Create a web API (python/java/other?). Plotting/presentation then becomes important
reading online news for estimations? deep webscraping
