Testing of web scraping.

Cannot extract detailed (eg monthly) FTSE list data.
Update - seems alot of sites have blocking for bots and scraping. Most insitutions pay sub for data.

Required for test code to work - externally loaded csv file of FTSE data date, ohlc, adjusted, volume.
Test date manipulation for algorithms/comparisons
FTSE index data will just be used for benchmarking
